This repo is an implementation of the paper "Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks" 

## Some key points from the paper 

- This paper uses Conditional GANs which is very similar to traditional GANs except that it has a class label for every train image
- For the generator, a U-Net Based architechture is used
- For the discriminator, we use a PatchGAN classifier
- We use minibatch Stochastic Gradient Desent(SGD) and apply Adam solver with a learning rate of 0.0002 and momentum parameters B1 = 0.5 and B2 = 0.999

(ðŸ™ƒImage is too big to take a good ss, so refer to the architechture)
